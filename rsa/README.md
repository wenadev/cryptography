## Overview

In a public-key system using RSA, the ciphertext is intercepted as '10' with a public key of       
C = 10 sent to a user whose public key is {e = 5, n = 35}. 

The program finds the corresponding plaintext by bruteforcing the answer, the program also reveals the secret exponent in a private key {d = ?, n = 35}
